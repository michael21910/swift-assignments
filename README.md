# Swift Assignments
This repo contains assignments for Swift class when I was a junior in NDHU.

The discription of the problems are as follows:
* [Assignment 1](Assignment1)
    * [Q1](Assignment1/Q1/Q1.swift)
        * Write a function getE(n) that returns the summation of the first n terms in the following expression.
        * For example:
            * getE(1) = 1
            * getE(2) = 2
            * getE(3) = 2.5
    * [Q2](Assignment1/Q2/Q2.swift)
        * Write a function gradeLevel that takes an array of integers and returns their corresponding level distributions according to the level mapping rules: 80 to 100 → A, 60 to 79 → B, and below 60 → C.
        * For example, gradeLevel([80, 90, 75, 50]) returns:
            * A: 2
            * B: 1
            * C: 1
    * [Q3](Assignment1/Q3/Q3.swift)
        * Rectangle representation: Create a class Rectangle. This class has two stored properties length and width, and two computed properties perimeter and area (with getters only). Please provide an initializer to the stored properties.
        * For example:
            * var rectangleA = Rectangle(length: 10, width: 20)
            * rectangleA.perimeter //return 60
            * rectangleA.area // return 200
  
* [Assignment2](Assignment2)
   * Design a simple temperature converter from Fahrenheit to Celsius
